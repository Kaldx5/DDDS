> üéì **Final Grade: AA ‚Äì Computer Engineering Graduation Project 2024‚Äì2025**  
> Developed and presented at Istanbul Okan University  
> Supervised by: Asst. Prof. Emel Ko√ß

A real-time drowsiness detection system powered by TinyML and computer vision, designed to monitor driver alertness using a webcam and low-power embedded devices.

---

## üß† Project Summary

The Driver Drowsiness Detection System (DDDS) detects fatigue symptoms such as prolonged eye closure and yawning using:
- **Facial Landmark Detection** (via MediaPipe)
- **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) & Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)**
- **TinyML model (TensorFlow Lite)** for classification
- **Audio and Visual Alerts** to help prevent accidents
- **Event Logging** for timestamped records

---

## üì∑ System Overview

- **Input**: Live webcam or ESP32-CAM feed  
- **Processing**: EAR/MAR or ML inference  
- **Output**: Real-time status display, alarm audio, event log

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Real-time facial landmark detection  
- EAR & MAR threshold logic  
- Optional ML model inference via TensorFlow Lite  
- Alarm sound via Pygame  
- Event log file with timestamps
